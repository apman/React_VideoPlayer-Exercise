# React Video-Player Exercise 

(Started with tutorial: https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/ )
Updated to make components more reusable and use Polaris components
(no styling applied - so still looks horrible! But this was just to get into React ...)

### Getting Started

Checkout this repo, install dependencies, then start the server :

```
> npm install
> npm start
```
